The AI engineer's work trajectory involved an iterative process of developing a web application, starting from a pitch deck and evolving into a full-fledged professional website. Initially, the user requested a pitch deck focused on layout and design, which the AI delivered. However, the core of the work shifted dramatically when the user pivoted to desiring a professional, live website inspired by , with an emphasis on amazing graphics and beautiful and compelling layout. This led to several design iterations, bug fixes (primarily related to JSX syntax, SVG encoding, and animation stability), and continuous refinement based on explicit user feedback regarding aesthetic quality and functionality. The AI demonstrated persistence in meeting the user's escalating design expectations, culminating in efforts to achieve an investment-grade look, and is currently implementing a dark theme with specific accent colors.

<product_requirements>
The user's initial request was to improve the layout and add graphics for an ultra-professional looking pitch deck in A4 landscape layout, specifically for a board presentation, with a focus on layout and design only.

The requirements then evolved significantly to building a professional looking website with all buttons and links connected so that it can go live. The user provided content documents (INGENIOUS CAPITAL LTD web text.docx, Draft accompaniment letter.docx) and a specific style reference: , emphasizing the need for amazing graphics and a beautiful and compelling layout.

Subsequent feedback highlighted a need for investment-grade quality, moving beyond basic black and white to truly sophisticated visuals and rich graphics. The user then reported flashing and disappearing text issues, requiring animation stability fixes. The latest requirement is a dark theme using greys and blacks, with hints of teal and burnt orange, specifically moving away from any purple.

    -   **Summary**: The FastAPI backend server. It handles API routes, database connections (MongoDB via ), and CORS settings. It defines basic models (, ) and API endpoints (, ).
    -   **Changes Made**: No significant changes were observed in the trajectory, it remains a foundational API setup. It currently serves as a basic health check and status logging, not directly integrated with the main website content yet.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The main entry point for the React application. It sets up client-side routing using  and includes a basic  component that makes an initial API call to the backend. This file was modified to integrate the main  component.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initial setup included  component. Later updated to render  as the primary application view.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: This component was created during the initial phase to build the A4 landscape pitch deck. It rendered the content from the business plan into a presentation-like format.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created initially. Its purpose was fulfilled and later superseded by the website development, indicating it might have been removed or commented out.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: This is the central and most extensively modified component for the Ingenious Capital website. It contains the entire website's structure, content sections (Hero, Our Approach, Services, Team, Investment Opportunities, Contact), and complex visual elements. It underwent multiple redesigns to meet the user's demanding aesthetic requirements for investment-grade quality, including rich graphics, advanced animations, and various UI effects (glass-morphism, parallax).
    -   **Changes Made**:
        *   **Initial creation**: Basic structure with content from provided documents.
        *   **Redesign 1 (Chat 39)**: Attempted to match  style, introducing dark themes, glass-morphism, scroll-triggered and mouse-parallax animations.
        *   **Bug fixes (Chat 43-49, 61-71)**: Multiple fixes for JSX syntax errors, unescaped SVG data URLs, and dynamic Tailwind class issues causing rendering problems (blank page, image loading issues).
        *   **Redesign 2 (Chat 57)**: Further enhancements with more sophisticated graphics and professional imagery (financial district skyline, team portraits, office interiors) and advanced blue/purple gradients.
        *   **Animation stability fixes (Chat 76-82)**: Removal of problematic  components and simplification of animations to address flashing text issues.
        *   **Theme change (Chat 88)**: Most recently, modified to implement a dark theme with greys, blacks, and hints of teal and burnt orange, removing previous purple gradients.
-   ** & **:
    -   **Summary**: Modular components created to structure specific sections of the Ingenious Capital website.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created in Chat 28, likely integrated into .
-   ** & **:
    -   **Summary**: These files define the global styling and Tailwind CSS configuration, including custom colors, spacing, and animations, crucial for achieving the desired aesthetic.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to support the various design iterations, including new color palettes (e.g., dark theme, teal/burnt orange accents) and animation keyframes.

<pending_tasks>
- Take a screenshot of the newly implemented dark theme to present to the user.
- Await user feedback on the new dark theme and color palette.
- Backend integration for the contact form functionality, as it's currently frontend-only.
- Implement any further design adjustments or functionalities the user may request.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with transforming the website's theme to a dark mode, specifically using greys and blacks with hints of teal and burnt orange, while explicitly removing any purple hues.

The AI engineer has just completed modifying the  file to implement these new color requirements and update the overall visual aesthetic. This involves changes to Tailwind CSS classes for background colors, text colors, gradients, and accent elements to reflect the new theme. The  file is the central component for the entire website, so this modification affects the global appearance.

The last action taken was successfully writing the modified  file and confirming the supervisor status of the frontend and backend services, indicating that the changes have been applied and the development environment is stable. The very next step planned is to capture a screenshot of the updated website.
